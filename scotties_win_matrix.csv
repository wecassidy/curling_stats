# Use historical skip-vs-skip win records in Curling Canada events,
# where available [1], including round-robin play from this year
# (where applicable). Apply Laplace's rule of succession to those
# record to get win probability. For example, Jennifer Jones is 9-10
# against Rachel Homan [2]. Add one win and one loss to the record to
# estimate the probability of MB beating ON as 0.476.

# Where Curling Canada data is not available, naively estimate the win
# probability as 0.5 for both teams. Diagonal entries represent teams
# playing themselves and so strictly speaking are nonsense, but should
# be 0.5 to satisfy simplistic verification logic.
